# Customers Churn and Retention Analysis — Veritas Bank

</div>

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes energy consumption and maintenance patterns across rental units managed by **HomeTech Solutions**, using smart sensor data to uncover inefficiencies, behavioral drivers of energy usage, and maintenance trends. The goal was to support data-driven decisions that reduce energy waste, improve system reliability, and optimize operational planning.

The analysis focused on energy usage patterns, HVAC maintenance activity, tenant behavior, and seasonal demand fluctuations, with insights visualized through dashboards for clear stakeholder communication.

---

## 🎯 Business Challenge
HomeTech Solutions faced increasing energy costs and frequent maintenance incidents across its rental units. Key challenges included:
- Limited visibility into unit-level energy consumption
- High frequency of HVAC-related failures
- Seasonal energy spikes during warmer months
- Variability in tenant behavior affecting energy efficiency

Without clear insights, it was difficult to proactively manage maintenance and control energy usage.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Monitor and benchmark energy consumption across rental units
- Analyze tenant behavior and temperature preferences
- Assess HVAC maintenance trends and system efficiency
- Identify seasonal and unit-level energy patterns
- Visualize insights to support operational decision-making

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- **Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, summary statistics, pivot tables, and dashboard creation  
- **Data Sources:** Smart sensor readings, maintenance logs, occupancy behavior data

---

## 📈 Key Findings & Insights

### 🔹 Energy Consumption Patterns
- **Total annual energy consumption:** 71,966.07 kWh  
- **Peak consumption period:** June to August  
- Energy usage increased significantly during summer months, aligning with higher cooling demand.

---

### 🔹 Maintenance & HVAC Performance
- **Total maintenance incidents:** 354  
- HVAC failures accounted for the majority of maintenance issues throughout the year.
- **Filter replacements peaked in May and August**, briefly overtaking HVAC failures.
- **Unit U493** recorded the highest number of maintenance calls (13), indicating a potential system or usage anomaly.

---

### 🔹 Tenant Behavior & Temperature Preferences
- Tenants preferring **cooler indoor temperatures** consistently consumed more energy.
- Warmer temperature settings correlated with lower overall energy usage.
- Units with **higher occupancy levels** showed increased energy consumption, while frequently vacant units used less energy.

---

### 🔹 System & Environmental Benchmarks
- **Average indoor temperature across units:** 69.81°F  
- Energy demand and maintenance activity showed strong seasonal alignment with hotter periods.

---

## 🖥 Dashboard Highlights
The dashboards provided visibility into:
- Monthly energy consumption trends
- HVAC vs. non-HVAC maintenance distribution
- Unit-level maintenance frequency
- Seasonal peaks in energy demand
- Behavioral drivers of energy usage

## ✅ Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions were recommended:

- Schedule **preventive HVAC inspections** ahead of peak usage months (June–August)
- Encourage **energy-efficient temperature settings**, especially for tenants preferring cooler environments
- Prioritize **filter replacements in May, July, and August**
- Monitor **high-occupancy units** for increased energy load
- Flag units with unusually high maintenance activity for deeper investigation

---

## 📌 Business Impact
Implementing these recommendations can help HomeTech Solutions:
- Reduce energy waste and operational costs
- Minimize HVAC downtime through proactive maintenance
- Improve tenant comfort while balancing efficiency
- Support long-term sustainability initiatives using data-driven insights
