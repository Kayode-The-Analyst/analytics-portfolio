title: Optimizing Energy Usage in Rental Units Using Smart Sensors
---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes energy consumption and maintenance patterns across rental units using **Microsoft Excel**. Smart sensor data was explored to understand HVAC failures, tenant temperature preferences, occupancy behavior, and seasonal energy peaks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor and benchmark energy consumption
- Analyze tenant behavior and energy usage
- Assess HVAC maintenance trends
- Visualize patterns using Excel dashboards

## 🛠 Tool Used
**Microsoft Excel (only tool used)**  
Data cleaning, analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Total annual energy consumption: **71,966 kWh**
- **354 maintenance incidents**, mostly HVAC related
- Peak energy usage: **June – August**
- Tenants preferring cooler temperatures consumed more energy
- Unit **U493** had the highest maintenance calls (13)
- Filter replacements peaked in May and August

## ✅ Recommendations
- Schedule HVAC inspections before summer
- Encourage energy-efficient temperature settings
- Monitor high-occupancy units
- Improve preventive maintenance planning
