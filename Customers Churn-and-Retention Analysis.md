</div>


## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for Veritas Bank across the UK, Germany, and France using SQL and Power BI. The goal was to identify key churn drivers and provide data-driven retention strategies based on demographics, region, and product engagement.

- 10,000 customers analyzed
- $271.54M total revenue studied
- Overall churn rate: 13.85%

## 📈 Key Insights
- Germany (18.06%) and France (17.52%) have churn rates well above average

- Young adults show the highest churn risk (14.89%)
- 1,058 credit card owners are inactive — a re-engagement opportunity
