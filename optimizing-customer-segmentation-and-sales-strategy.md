- 500 customers | 5,000 orders | 100 products
- $9.74M total revenue with 38% profit margin

## 📈 Key Insights
- Revenue peaks in May and drops significantly by July, showing seasonality
- West region is the strongest market; North is the weakest

- High-CLTV customers (239) drive most long-term value
- Many low-CLTV customers can be upgraded by increasing order frequency
