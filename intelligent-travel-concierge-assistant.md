# Improving Customer Support Efficiency and CSAT — GrandStay Hospitality

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer support operations at GrandStay to uncover the root causes of low customer satisfaction (CSAT), frequent SLA breaches, and high ticket escalations across regions.

The analysis revealed that the problem was not agent performance, but structural issues in knowledge management, process design, and demand handling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify drivers of low CSAT and SLA failures
- Analyze ticket handling, escalation patterns, and channel performance
- Evaluate effectiveness of the Knowledge Base (KB)
- Recommend structural improvements to support operations

## 🛠 Focus Areas
- First response time and its impact on CSAT
- Ticket volume vs abandonment rate
- Escalation handling and approval bottlenecks
- Knowledge Base effectiveness
- Channel performance (Chat vs Phone vs Email)

## 📈 Key Insights
- Average CSAT is 3.23 and drops when response time exceeds 5 minutes
- 62,000 SLA breaches recorded across regions
- Chat channel delivers higher satisfaction than phone and email
- 5,000 tickets escalated with an average handle time of 15.75 hours
- Agents spend 3.65 hours searching the KB without resolution
- 40% of tickets are repetitive and suitable for automation

## 💡 Root Cause
Support inefficiencies are driven by outdated KB content, unclear decision rights, policy gaps, billing complexity, and poor process design — not agent effort.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Redesign and re-index the Knowledge Base with decision trees and clear escalation paths
- Introduce chatbots and self-service for repetitive requests
- Implement chat-first routing and dynamic staffing during peak hours
- Reduce unnecessary escalations with better agent authority and templates
- Track KPIs: FCR, CSAT by peak hour, escalation rate, KB success rate, cost per contact

## 📌 Outcome
The project provided a structural roadmap to improve CSAT, reduce SLA breaches, lower support costs, and stabilize customer support operations through knowledge, process, and demand optimization.
